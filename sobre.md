Hi,

my name is Marcos Takeshi. Call me takeshi.

Currently i'm a big data engineer specialist at [Semantix](http://www.semantix.com.br), São Paulo, Brazil.

It's not the ideal but i'm always trying a lot of projects at the same time... I think that's why they never end :\|  But they're part of my interests like technology in general, software development, hardware (arduino, raspberrypi, sensors), automation (garden, house), papercraft and woodcraft.

I also click with my Canon SL1 sometimes but rarely make them available to others. Maybe I should publish more... pics, knowledge, projects, ideas.

For contact, you may send me an email **marcos.takeshi(at)gmail.com**.
